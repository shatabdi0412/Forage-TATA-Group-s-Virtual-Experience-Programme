# Forage-TATA-Group-s-Virtual-Experience-Programme
Please provide a detailed account of my participation in the TATA Group's Virtual Experience Programme.

The virtual experience program commences by providing us with essential background information about the task, which is detailed as follows.

An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review its data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year. The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what’s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information available in the data. A meeting with the CEO and CMO has been scheduled for next month and you need to draft the relevant analytics and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to decide on expansion.

We are given 4 tasks to complete for this programme and they are:

1. Farming the Business Scenario
2. Choosing the Right Visuals
3. Creating Effective Visuals
4. Communicating Insights and Analysis

# Farming the Business Scenario
In this assignment, we needed to generate 8 key questions - 4 for the CEO and 4 for the CMO - based on a provided sales dataset. These questions will be instrumental in shaping our presentation to these executives and extracting pertinent insights from the data.
The CEO's focus is primarily on company revenue and its sources, while the CMO is more concerned with specific product and customer insights to shape marketing strategies. Here are the questions for each:
CEO -
What is the overall revenue of the year 2011?
Which are the highest and lowest revenue generation regions?
Is there any seasonal trend?
What is the revenue breakdown by product, customer ID, and country?

CMO -
What are the top 5 most sold items?
Which are the highest and lowest revenue-generating items?
How many repeaters do we have and are they ordering the same product as before or a new one?
What percentage of sales do the repeaters represent?

# Choosing the Right Visuals
In this task, we'll be presented with questions and need to choose the most suitable graphs to assist the CEO and CMO in visualizing and understanding the data. It involves 5 multiple-choice questions, with one example as follows:

Q  -   The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the entire year. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year. Which visual would most likely help the CEO analyse the data?

A - To answer this question, we should select a line chart to depict monthly revenue. Line charts are ideal for visualizing time series data, with time on the x-axis and revenue on the y-axis. This choice provides the CEO with a quick overview of revenue trends, helping them grasp seasonal variations and make more accurate revenue forecasts.

# Creating Effective Visuals
Here, we dive into creating visualizations for both the CEO and CMO. The task involves crafting four visuals to address two questions from each of them.

Question 1
The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

Question 2
The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

Question 3
The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

Question 4
The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

We are also told that there are some errors in the data and that we must clean the data before beginning our analysis.

DATA CLEANUP -
Before starting the analysis, ensure proper data cleaning. Address issues like negative return quantities and incorrectly input unit prices by following these steps.
1. Create a check that the quantity should not be below 1 unit
2. Create a check that the Unit price should not be below $0

To implement the mentioned checks, use conditional formulas to exclude data that meets certain conditions. Additionally, utilize data transformation techniques to eliminate flawed data, as detailed in the provided resources section. Ensure the data is clean before proceeding with any analysis.

I began by opening the dataset in Tableau and applying filtering conditions to remove the data errors mentioned earlier. Thankfully, Tableau simplifies this process. Afterwards, I crafted visualizations for the four questions, which you can view here.

# Communicating Insights and Analysis
Now that we have curated the visuals to answer the CEO’s and CMO’s questions, it is time to present our findings to them! In this task, we have to develop a script and record a video presentation, presenting our findings to the CEO and CMO based on the questions they have asked. The video should be approximately 5 minutes in length. This task is arguably the most important task as it tests our communication skills. We could have derived amazing insights and created beautiful visuals, but if we did not communicate our findings to the different stakeholders effectively, they would all be useless!
